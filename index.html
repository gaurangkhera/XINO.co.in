                  XINO, the computer club of DPS Rohini comprises of die hard fanatics of technology whose passion for
                  the technological science verges on borderline crazy. We comprise of 25+ brilliant minds, each
                  posessing a unique perspective of analysing the world around us.

                  "When all think alike, then no one is thinking." We value different ideas, dreams and aspirations of
                  our members and work our best to turn those dreams into reality. "It isn't the incompetent who destroy
                  an organization. The incompetent never get in a position to destroy it. It is those who achieved
                  something and want to rest upon their achievements who are forever clogging things up". We appreciate
                  our achievements but never stop our crusade to acheive long lasting glory in the field of
                  technological sciences. We have taken the competition scene in Delhi by storm, winning innummerable
                  events but never letting it get in our way of learning.
